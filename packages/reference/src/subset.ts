/**
 * subset — chant's implementation of the SHAPE layer of the TypeScript-as-Data
 * specification (chant #1024, epic #1019).
 *
 * ## The specification is normative; this file implements it
 *
 * Since INTENTIUS/typescript-as-data#33 (2026-09-10) the subset is defined by
 * the specification at https://github.com/INTENTIUS/typescript-as-data, not by
 * this file. The rules this module implements are the `S-*` productions of
 * `spec/grammar.md` §2 — S-Unwrap, S-Literal, S-Ident, S-Template, S-Tagged,
 * S-Object (S-Prop / S-Shorthand / S-SpreadProp), S-Array, S-Member, S-Index,
 * S-Unary, S-Binary, S-Conditional, S-New, the S-Call forms (S-CallHelper,
 * S-CallIntrinsic, S-CallEager, S-CallMethod, S-CompositeStep) and S-Reject —
 * and the direction rule `F-Direction` of `spec/divergence.md`: this classifier
 * may accept what `fold()` rejects, never the reverse, outside the two named
 * exceptions F-Exc-Lazy and F-Exc-Registry. The "environment-dependent
 * exceptions" enumerated below are `spec/divergence.md`'s F-Div-* rows, kept
 * here as implementation notes on WHY each resolution is out of this module's
 * reach.
 *
 * Changing the subset goes spec-first: propose and land the rule there (with a
 * fixture), then implement it here citing the identifier, then release. The
 * provisional path for a change needed before the rule can be written: land it
 * with the affected rule marked PROVISIONAL in this doc naming the spec issue;
 * a provisional marker may survive at most one release, and the docs may not
 * describe the change as supported until the rule exists. See
 * `spec/README.md` "Ownership" and chant #2354.
 *
 * `fold()` ({@link "./fold"}, the enforcement layer — a construct outside
 * this subset simply has no case there) and EVL001/EVL003
 * ({@link "../lint/rules/evl001-non-literal-expression"},
 * {@link "../lint/rules/evl003-dynamic-property-access"} — the pre-flight
 * diagnostic layer) both import this module so the two can never drift
 * apart on *which node kinds, operators, and key shapes* are foldable.
 * Before this module existed, `fold()` and EVL001 each hand-rolled their
 * own recursive classifier; they agreed almost everywhere but had several
 * real, silent gaps (see git history of #1024 for the enumerated list —
 * dynamic object-literal keys, template/tagged-template interiors, and
 * unrestricted binary/unary operators were all accepted by EVL001 but
 * rejected by `fold()`). This module is the fix: one classifier, two
 * importers.
 *
 * Scope — this module classifies *shape* only: the syntactic kind of an
 * expression, its operator, and (for keys) its literal-ness. It
 * deliberately does NOT resolve bindings or perform any evaluation, because
 * three things a full fold needs are inherently environment-dependent and
 * cannot be recovered from shape alone:
 *
 *   1. Identifier *resolution* — is a bare name actually a local `const`,
 *      vs. an unbound name? That needs the file's `consts` map. Both
 *      `fold()` and this module treat a bare identifier as shape-valid;
 *      `fold()` alone resolves it (and rejects if unresolved) once it has
 *      that map. A lint rule has no equivalent binding-resolution pass
 *      today, so EVL (via this module) stays permissive here — a known,
 *      intentional asymmetry, not a bug: it can only ever be a *false
 *      negative* on EVL's part (EVL passes something `fold()` might later
 *      reject for being unresolved), never the reverse.
 *
 *      chant #1169 adds one more resolution-dependent rejection in the same
 *      direction: an identifier bound to a same-file `const x = new T(...)`,
 *      used as a VALUE. It is shape-valid here; `fold()` answers it only when
 *      its caller pre-resolved that const to the one real instance the file
 *      built (`../discovery/fold-import.ts`), and rejects otherwise, because
 *      re-folding the initializer would construct a duplicate of a resource
 *      discovery has already registered. Shape cannot see the difference, and
 *      the rejection is a fall-back-to-run, never a wrong value.
 *
 *      chant #2328 adds another, in the same direction and for the same
 *      reason: a property or element read whose OBJECT resolves to `null` or
 *      `undefined` (`cfg.nett.vpcId`, a typo in a nested path). Running it
 *      throws a `TypeError`, so `fold()` refuses rather than answering
 *      `undefined` and letting the build carry on with the property dropped.
 *      What the object resolves to is exactly the resolution this module
 *      does not do, so `cfg.nett.vpcId` stays shape-valid here — and a
 *      genuinely optional `cfg.net?.vpcId`, which folds to `undefined`
 *      because JavaScript defines it that way, is shape-valid in both.
 *   2. Tagged-template *tag registration* — needs a lexicon's intrinsics
 *      manifest, which isn't available to a syntax-only lint rule. `fold()`
 *      alone checks it; this module treats any tag name as shape-valid and
 *      only classifies the interpolated values.
 *   2b. Authoring-helper *provenance* (chant #1082) — a call to a registered
 *      chant helper (`phase(...)`, `output(...)`; ./foldable-helpers.ts)
 *      folds, but only when the name is genuinely bound to an import of
 *      chant's own. That needs the module graph, which a syntax-only lint
 *      rule doesn't have. This module checks the NAME only and stays
 *      permissive; `fold()`'s bridge does the provenance check and falls the
 *      file back to run when it fails. Same direction as every other item
 *      here — a false negative for EVL, never a false positive.
 *   2c. Intrinsic *call-form* registration (chant #1044) — a plain call to a
 *      lexicon intrinsic the lexicon opted in (`Ref(bucket)`,
 *      `Concat(a, b)`; `IntrinsicDef.foldsAsCall`, ../lexicon.ts) folds.
 *      Whether a given name is such an intrinsic is not knowable from shape,
 *      so {@link findSubsetViolation} takes the registry as an OPTIONAL
 *      parameter instead of guessing: supply it and the answer for a call is
 *      exact (fold()'s own), omit it and every call is a violation, the
 *      pre-#1044 answer.
 *
 *      That parameter is the whole reason the call case lives here rather
 *      than only in `fold()`. This module is a shared predicate, and the
 *      point of a shared predicate is that a consumer can ask "will this
 *      fold?" without running fold — a control plane deciding whether a
 *      repository needs a sandboxed child process at all, for instance.
 *      Keeping the case out of here would make the predicate answer "no" for
 *      idiomatic `Ref(...)` source that `fold()` reduces cleanly: not a
 *      permissive gap but a systematically WRONG answer in the expensive
 *      direction, and the one direction this module is not allowed to be
 *      wrong in (see the false-negative/false-positive rule in point 1, and
 *      the flow-sensitivity note below — the single divergence in the other
 *      direction, and the one this module treats as a wart). A caller with
 *      no registry degrades to "assume it runs", which is safe and cheap to
 *      reason about.
 *
 *      chant #1106 — EVL is no longer such a caller by default. `runLint`
 *      (../lint/engine.ts) takes the active lexicons' `IntrinsicDef[]` as a
 *      parameter and puts it on `LintContext.intrinsics`
 *      (../lint/rule.ts), and EVL001 (evl001-non-literal-expression.ts)
 *      passes it straight through to `checkObjectMember`. `chant lint`'s
 *      three CLI entry points (the `lint` command's initial pass, its
 *      `--fix` re-lint, and the LSP's per-file diagnostics) all resolve the
 *      project's lexicons and thread their intrinsics through, mirroring
 *      how `discover()` has done it for the fold path since #1039/#1105 —
 *      so `chant lint` on a real project no longer flags `Ref(...)` that
 *      `fold()` accepts. A `LintContext` built without that plumbing (a
 *      unit test constructing one directly, a consumer that hasn't
 *      resolved lexicons) still gets the pre-#1044 conservative answer —
 *      that path was never wrong, only stricter than it had to be.
 *   3. Runtime *type* of a folded value — e.g. spreading `const n = 5`
 *      (`{...n}`) is shape-valid (`n` is a plain identifier) but `fold()`
 *      rejects it once it discovers `n` folds to a number, not an object.
 *      Only real evaluation catches this; EVL004 independently narrows
 *      spread sources to a stricter "traceable to a const" shape, which
 *      catches most real-world misuse without evaluating, but is not a
 *      full substitute.
 *
 * One more inherent gap, on the *value-flow* side rather than shape:
 * `fold()` evaluates `&&`/`||`/`??` and `? :` lazily — it only folds the
 * side/branch actually taken, exactly like the JS runtime — so an
 * otherwise-unfoldable *untaken* branch does not reject
 * (`false && sideEffect()` folds cleanly to `false`). This module (and so
 * EVL) is flow-insensitive: it has no notion of "taken", so it requires
 * every operand/branch to be shape-valid. This can only make EVL *stricter*
 * than `fold()` (a false positive relative to fold, flagging code the
 * folder would actually accept) — never the reverse. Making EVL
 * flow-sensitive would mean re-implementing an evaluator inside a lint
 * rule; out of scope here. See #1024.
