/**
 * fold — static AST value reducer (chant #1026/#1021/#1024, part of epic #1019)
 *
 * Implements judgment J1 (`F-Eval-*`, `spec/judgments.md`) and the value domain
 * (`F-Val-*`, `spec/values.md`) of the TypeScript-as-Data specification at
 * https://github.com/INTENTIUS/typescript-as-data, which is normative for the
 * subset since INTENTIUS/typescript-as-data#33. Each branch of {@link fold}
 * below is one F-Eval rule — the identifier branch is F-Eval-Ident, the
 * property-access branch F-Eval-Member (its numbered steps match), the call
 * branch F-Eval-CallHelper / CallIntrinsic / CallLocal / CallEager / CallMethod
 * in that order — and the envelope types here are F-Val-Domain's cases.
 * Subset changes go spec-first; see subset.ts's module doc for the process.
 *
 * Reduces a single-file TypeScript expression AST to a value with NO
 * module execution. The node-kind/operator/key subset it covers — literals,
 * template interpolation, object/array literals (incl. spread), `const`
 * identifier resolution, property and element access (incl. the
 * cross-resource `{ __attrRef }` case, literal-key-only), unary `!`/`-`,
 * the binary operators `+ - * / === !== > < >= <=`, short-circuit
 * `&& || ??`, conditional expressions, `as`/`satisfies`/`!`/parenthesized
 * unwrapping, a nested `new Type({...})` resource-as-value (chant #1169), and
 * registered lexicon intrinsic tagged templates — is defined ONCE, in
 * {@link "./subset"} ({@link findSubsetViolation}), and shared with EVL001/EVL003
 * ({@link "../lint/rules/evl001-non-literal-expression"}), so the linted
 * subset and the folded subset can never drift apart (#1024).
 *
 * chant #1169 closed the largest of the documented fold/EVL divergences in the
 * process: a nested `new Type(...)` used as a value was shape-valid for
 * `./subset` and rejected by `fold()`, because `fold()` could only produce the
 * `{__resource, props}` envelope and nothing constructed it. Now it folds to
 * that envelope and ../discovery/fold-import.ts constructs the REAL instance
 * from it. The remaining divergences are the resolution-dependent ones
 * ./subset's own module doc enumerates, plus one this change adds in the same
 * safe direction: a BARE identifier bound to a same-file `new` is shape-valid
 * there and rejected here, because folding it would build a duplicate of a
 * resource discovery already registered — see {@link fold}'s identifier branch.
 *
 * A `CallExpression` has almost no case — a function call as a value is
 * structurally unrepresentable, not merely linted against. Composite
 * factory calls are out of scope here (epic Phase 5, #1023). There are
 * exactly two exceptions, both closed allowlists of names declared
 * somewhere a human had to write them down, and both reducing to a symbolic
 * envelope that executes nothing here:
 *
 *   - a call to a REGISTERED chant authoring helper
 *     ({@link "./foldable-helpers"}, chant #1082) → {@link FoldedHelperCall};
 *   - a call to a lexicon intrinsic whose lexicon registered it AND opted
 *     its call form in ({@link intrinsicCallFolds}, ../lexicon.ts, chant
 *     #1044) → {@link FoldedIntrinsicCall}, the same `{__intrinsic}` family
 *     the tagged-template form already reduces to.
 *
 * chant #1373 adds a third, the only one that evaluates rather than
 * enveloping: a call to a PROJECT-LOCAL function — declared in this file or
 * imported from a sibling project file — whose body is itself inside the
 * fold subset. ../discovery/fold-import.ts hands such a function in through
 * `externals` as a {@link FoldableFunction}, and {@link callFoldableFunction}
 * folds its body against the defining module's scope with the folded
 * arguments bound. Still nothing is imported or run.
 *
 * A bare composite factory call (`Checkout({...})` on its own) is still out
 * of scope (epic Phase 5, #1023 covers only interpreting a factory's OWN
 * body, not consuming its result as a value elsewhere). chant #1174 adds one
 * narrow exception at the PROPERTY-ACCESS level rather than here: the
 * `<Identifier>(...).step` idiom — see {@link FoldedCompositeStepCall} on the
 * property-access branch below. A call with no `.step` narrowing, or any
 * other member, still throws from this branch exactly as before.
 *
 * chant #1966 adds a fourth call shape, and a method call on top of any of
 * the four: a lexicon-package function its lexicon registered with
 * {@link intrinsicCallFoldsEagerly} (../lexicon.ts) evaluates eagerly —
 * unlike the other three, which envelope for later revival — because its
 * usual use (`` `${matrix("os")}` ``) coerces the result via `String()` at
 * fold time, before any revival would run. A `CallExpression` whose callee is
 * a property access — `github.actor.toString()`, `[...].join(",")`,
 * `matrix("os").toString()` — folds its receiver and calls the named method
 * on it directly, PROVIDED the receiver is a real value and not one of
 * fold's own symbolic envelopes (see {@link isFoldSymbolicEnvelope}); nothing
 * about the method name is otherwise restricted.
 *
 * Everything else — an ordinary package function, an array `.map`, a
 * registered name shadowed by a local binding — still throws.
 *
 * Cross-file identifier resolution (chant #1020): `consts` alone is always
 * this file's own top-level bindings — that part stays single-file, and
 * nothing about the supported node-kind subset changes. But an identifier
 * `fold()` can't find in `consts` isn't necessarily a dead end: the optional
 * `externals` map (populated by ../discovery/fold-import.ts, which owns the
 * module graph traversal) lets a caller pre-resolve an *imported* binding to
 * its real value — a plain value for an imported `const`, or the REAL,
 * already-constructed `Declarable`/`CompositeInstance` for a name bound to a
 * resource/composite in the defining module — and `fold()` just returns it
 * for the identifier, unchanged. This is why a bare object/array bracket
 * index a few lines down (`obj[key]`) is enough to make `network.vpc.VpcId`
 * fold correctly once `network` resolves via `externals` to the real,
 * shared composite instance object: indexing a live class instance the same
 * way as a plain object returns its real getter's real `AttrRef`, wired to
 * the real shared parent — see fold-import.ts's module doc for why that
 * shared identity is the entire hard part of #1020.

 * optimized/inlined frames requires V8 to reconstruct them from deopt
 * metadata, confirmed via `sample` to dominate CPU during the observed
 * multi-minute stall (`Isolate::CaptureAndSetErrorStack` /
 * `OptimizedJSFrame::Summarize` / `DeoptTranslationIterator`). Most files in
 * the corpus (77/98 entries have at least one run-fallback file) throw one
 * of these, so the cost compounds across a build. `Error.stackTraceLimit = 0`
 * for the duration of `super()` makes V8 capture zero frames — free
 * regardless of stack depth/optimization state — then the limit is restored
